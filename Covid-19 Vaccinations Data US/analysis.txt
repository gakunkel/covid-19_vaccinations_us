US COVID-19 Vaccination Progress
-----------------------------------

1.) Between 12/20/2020 and 05/08/2021, the United States as a whole has done an impressive job of dramatically decreasing the occurrence of new cases and deaths from Covid-19. This can be attributed to the steadily increasing percentage of Americans who have been fully vaccinated, which as of 05/08/2021 is nearing 35%.

2.) The United States continues to consistently administer a high percentage of available/distributed vaccine doses to the public.

3.) Amongst states and territories and adjusting for population size, the Republic of Palau has administered the most Covid-19 vaccine doses (115,123 per 100,000 residents), while the Federated States of Micronesia has administered the fewest (35,830 per 100,000 residents). Note: these numbers account for doses administered, not people fully vaccinated. The majority of US states and territories hover between 60,000 and 90,000 doses per 100,000 residents.

4.) Vaccinations per day in the United States peaked at 3,384,387 on 04/13/2021. Daily vaccinations have been decreasing since this date.

5.) Most states have fully vaccinated 30-40% of their population.
